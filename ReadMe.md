# Hollow Knight: SafeGodseekerQoL

SafeGodseekerQoL provides a carefully selected set of features inspired by Godseeker+ and QoL mods, emphasizing stability and predictability. This version prioritizes a core set of bug-free functionalities.

**Implemented Features:**

*   **Godseeker+ Inspired:**
    *   **Segmented Pantheon (P5):** Adds a pantheon entry to the left of the entrance of the Land of Storms, allowing you to select a segment of the Pantheon of Hallownest to challenge (split at the bench room).
    *   **Grubsong Preservation:** Charms that were equipped in the Pantheon are saved after returning to the Pantheon.
    *   **Endless Bossfight Restart (Hall of Gods):** Immediately restarts a bossfight in the Hall of Gods.
        *   Configuration option to either continue after a win or quit the game. (Addresses GS+ bug: Soul is *not* reset before next attempt.)
    *   **Add Soul/Lifeblood Before Fight (Hall of Gods):** Allows you to add Soul/Lifeblood before starting a fight.
    *   **Reduce Player Damage (Ascended):** Reduces damage *taken* by the player by 2x in Ascended difficulty.
    *   **Reduce Boss HP (Ascended/Radiant):** Reduces boss HP to the values used in the Fifth Pantheon for Ascended and Radiant difficulties.
    *   **Zote Animation Choice:** Allows you to choose between long and short Zote animations.
    *   **Fast Dreamgate:** Increases the speed of using the Dreamgate.

*   **QoL Inspired:**
    *   **Skip Boss Cutscenes:** (Pure Vessel, Radiance, Soul Tyrant, Soul Master) - Functionality limited *only* to the cutscene, preventing unintended gameplay advantages (e.g., nail charge on Radiance).
    *   **Skip Nightmare King Grimm Cutscene.**
